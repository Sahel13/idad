# Implicit Deep Adaptive Design (iDAD)

This is code for iDAD [1] modified for use in the paper "Nesting Particle Filters for Experimental Design in Dynamical Systems" [2].

To set up the Python environment and run experiments, follow the instructions at the [original repo](https://github.com/desi-ivanova/idad). The four experiments implemented for [2] are `pendulum_linear.py`, `pendulum.py`, `cartpole.py`, and `double_pendulum.py`. The sPCE lower bound for the trained models can be computed using `eval_sPCE.py`. To compute the EIG estimate for the trained models, run the respective file `{experiment_name}_eig.py`.
